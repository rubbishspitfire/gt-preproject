    <p>  Total Fitness caught up with the celeb trainer to talk all things fitness, her A-list clientele, and her fave activewear brands. </p>
      
     <p>We asked her a few questions:</p> 
      
     <p>How did you get your started in the fitness business?Ironically, I was very insecure, unhappy, unhealthy, drinking, smoking cigarettes, and eating unhealthy foods. Although I was grateful to be able to pay my bills, I was feeling lost about my purpose and direction. I was 22 and a waitress. I was going through a depression and was feeling really lost. I had heard from a friend that Pilates was a great workout that really made you feel good so I decided to sign up for a class. The first day I walked in, the owner of the studio thought she recognized me from somewhere and asked if I was an instructor. It made no sense to me at the time - I was so unhealthy and in such a low place. I thought to myself, “How could she possibly think my role was to inspire someone?” But once she asked the question, I heard myself say, “Maybe I could be.” That ‘maybe I could be’ started my entire career. 
      Can you tell us a bit about Fit by Kit…what makes it different?Fit by Kit is about my style of teaching. It focuses more on empowerment rather than inches lost. I used to have severe body dysmorphia so anything that focuses too much on the superficial doesn’t work for me. I’ve found that when I focus more on how I am feeling, hone in on being joyous, and concentrate on being strong, I transform into the person I am meant to be. I’m all about the 3 or 30 mantra. It helped me lose 30 pounds and it helped my clients stay consistent with their routines. The 3 or 30 rule is choosing to do 30 minutes of any type of exercise a day, or, 3 miles a day. You decide. It’s a simple mantra to stay excited, consistent, and empowered by fitness. It’s a balanced approach and nothing extreme. It’s achievable. </p>
